KeyboardLayoutCaps
==================

An application that switches keyboard layouts using Caps Lock key in the following way:
1. Caps Lock: switch to primary language
2. Shift + Caps Lock: switch to secondary language


NOT FINAL, NO SETUP, NO CONFIGURATION, USE AT OWN RISK.


Basicaly, this is https://github.com/victor-homyakov/recaps/ with everything, but the
core functionality removed. There is no tray icon, menu, not dependency on MFC headers,
no window, it only intercepts Caps Lock, Shift + Caps Lock and sort of Alt + Caps Lock.

Todo
====

1. Add installer
2. Add file-based configuration
